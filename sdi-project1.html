	I usually wake up every morning to go the gym with a buddy. My alarm goes off at 6AM, I snooze a few times.
My buddy usually text-messages me at 6:30 to tell me if he's up for it or not. If he doesn't go, 
I don't go (because, that's why!). He didn't text me, so I leave at 6:40 to get there by 7:00 AM. Changes.
